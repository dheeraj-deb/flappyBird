# flappyBird
This repository contains a clone of the classic Flappy Bird game implemented in JavaScript. In addition to the faithful reproduction of the gameplay, this project features Firebase integration for storing and displaying high scores. Challenge your reflexes and see if you can beat your own high score, or even compete on the global leaderboard.
